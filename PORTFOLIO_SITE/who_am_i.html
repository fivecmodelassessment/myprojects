  	<p class="introduction who_am_i_text">Hello there and thank you for visiting my site. My name is Georgi Dimitranov, a 20-year-old self-taught front end designer who wants to become a professional. I'm based in Bulgaria, Plovdiv and I  study Software technologies and design at the University of Plovdiv.
My main goal for making this site is taking the interest of employers by presenting my self and my work,
and by that getting employed as a front-end internship.
I've studied front end development for more than a year now but every day I learn something new, by experimenting and applying my skills in my own projects.</p>
<p class="under-title the_vision">The <span>VISION</span></p>
	<p class="introduction the_vision_text">A pattern which will unlock a vast majority of beautiful and eye-catching designs. Symmetri and Depth are of great value to me in the process. Color waterfalls and Font fields are the Skin and Face of one's design. Speed and Transitions are the blood and veins of the User Experience. My VISION is "Beauty and Speed".</p>

<p class="under-title the_quest">The <span>QUEST</span></p>
	<p class="introduction the_quest_text">I intent to bring user-friendly and simple designs but the quest of building a solid, beautiful and functional design to me is no as short as needed to be. But by experience, i will learn how to use the SWORD and SHIELD of Front-End development.</p>
